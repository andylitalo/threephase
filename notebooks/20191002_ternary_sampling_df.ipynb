    "# Analysis for Sampling Ternary System\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment began shortly before 4pm on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019. We continued with the same initial solution throughout the rest of the experimental time frame through October 11th, 2019 because of the time required to clean and reload the Parr reactor in the N2 glovebox (~1 day turnaround). Instead, we added cyclopentane to change the recipe by pumping it in with the ISCO pump.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concerns\n",
    "    -Vapor leak changes composition of CO2, current method for accounting for it is heuristic and based on Huikuan's PC-SAFT model (which we were are trying to validate)\n",
    "    -Vapor leak also changes composition of C5, which I have not accounted for\n",
    "    -Not getting good matching for high pressure or low temperature, possibly because of drift in accuracy of composition\n",
    "    -Vapor phase sampling is at a much lower pressure and typically lower temperature (ambient for both) than the headspace in the Parr reactor, resulting in a much lower pressure of the vapor in the GC, so the density must be corrected with a PC-SAFT estimate of the total density (only weight fractions are used from GC, which may be inaccurate in the case of evaporation of a liquid headspace at high pressures)\n",
    "    -A non-negligible amount of liquid is extracted for sampling (1-2 mL), which can dramatically change the amount of polyol and cyclopentane (and perhaps even CO2) in the Parr reactor. Because we don't know exactly how much is sampled, however, we must rely on a heuristic estimate to predict the amount that has been lost due to sampling at each measurement. So far, this heuristic assumes that only cyclopentane and polyol have been sampled, but perhaps we should include CO2 as well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Correcting for CO2 Leak\n",
    "\n",
    "If I don't correct for leak, the data are obviously off, with the expected density of CO2 being greater than the density in either of the sampled phases. If I use the mass of CO2 predicted under the conditions of each experiment by the PC-SAFT model, I underestimate the CO2 mass resulting in a total density around the measured density of CO2 in the vapor phase (although the density of CO2 in the vapor phase is modified based on the predicted density of the vapor phase assuming the same density as a CO2-C5 mixture in equilibrium with its liquid phase). Right now, I am estimating the leak based on the drop in expected mass predicted by the PC-SAFT model during each pressure step, which assumes a constant leak rate for each pressure step. The result is something in between, and thus, reasonable, but likely still inaccurate (I think it overestimates the density from my observations). Nevertheless, I cannot justify another approximation that would more accurately estimate the amount of CO2 lost through the leak."
